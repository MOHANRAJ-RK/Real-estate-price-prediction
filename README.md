# Real-estate-price-prediction
We build a real estate price prediction website for chennai city that allows user to determine the right cost to purchase a house by looking at various features such  as square feet, BHK, no of bathrooms and location which are given as input by the user to avoid broker.
 In this project we are going to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first collect the dataset from kaggle.Com, then clean it and perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) using numpy and matplotlib to build a model using sklearn in ‘jupyter notebook’. Second step will be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square feet area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
